The main command-line interface for the **n8n-as-code** ecosystem. Manage, synchronize, and version-control your n8n workflows as TypeScript files.

> This package also embeds the synchronization engine and exposes it as a library for the VS Code extension.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @n8n-as-code/cli
```

## Commands

### `init`
Interactive wizard — configure the connection to an n8n instance and pick the active project.

```bash
n8nac init
```

Creates `n8nac.json` in the current folder and stores the API key outside the repo.

---

### `switch`
Switch the active n8n project (updates `projectId` / `projectName` in `n8nac.json`).

```bash
n8nac switch
```

---

### `list`
Display workflow status in a git-like model. By default shows combined local and remote workflows.

```bash
n8nac list                    # Combined view (default)
n8nac list --local            # Show only local workflows
n8nac list --remote           # Show only remote workflows (alias: --distant)
```

Output columns: `Status` · `ID` · `Name` · `Local Path`

Status values:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `TRACKED`             | Workflow exists on both sides, no local changes detected             | Nothing to do |
| `MODIFIED_LOCALLY`    | Local file changed since last sync | `push --workflowsid` |
| `CONFLICT`            | Both sides changed — detected at push/pull time | `pull --workflowsid` (keep remote) or `push --workflowsid` (keep local) |
| `EXIST_ONLY_LOCALLY`  | New local file not yet in n8n (or remote was deleted) | `push --workflowsid` to create in n8n |
| `EXIST_ONLY_REMOTELY` | Remote workflow not yet local (or local was deleted) | `pull --workflowsid` to download |

> **Git-like sync**: Status is a point-in-time observation. Use `fetch` to update remote state cache.
> **For agents**: always run `n8nac list` first to get workflow IDs and their current status before pulling or pushing.

---

### `fetch --workflowsid <workflowId>`
Update remote state cache for a specific workflow (internal reference for comparison).

```bash
n8nac fetch --workflowsid <workflowId>          # Fetch specific workflow's remote state
```

- Updates internal comparison cache for the specified workflow only
- Use before `list` to ensure status reflects latest remote state for that workflow
- Required for accurate conflict detection
- For heavy instances, fetch individual workflows rather than all at once

---

### `pull --workflowsid <workflowId>`
Download a single workflow from n8n and overwrite the local file.

```bash
n8nac pull --workflowsid <workflowId>
```

> Recommended for agents and scripts. Targets exactly one workflow.

---

### `push --workflowsid <workflowId>`
Upload a single local workflow file to n8n.

```bash
n8nac push --workflowsid <workflowId>
```

> Recommended for agents and scripts. Targets exactly one workflow.

---

### `update-ai`
Generate or refresh AI context files in the project root:
- `AGENTS.md` — instructions for AI agents
- `n8nac-skills` / `n8nac-skills.cmd` — local shim for the skills CLI
- `n8nac` / `n8nac.cmd` — local shim for this CLI

```bash
n8nac update-ai
```

---

### `convert`
Convert a single workflow between JSON and TypeScript formats.

```bash
n8nac convert <file>
n8nac convert my-workflow.json --format typescript
n8nac convert my-workflow.workflow.ts --format json
```

### `convert-batch`
Batch-convert all workflows in a directory.

```bash
n8nac convert-batch workflows/ --format typescript
```

---

## 🤖 Agent workflow

The intended flow for an AI agent editing a workflow:

```bash
# 1. Fetch current state and get workflow IDs
n8nac list

# 2. Pull the target workflow
n8nac pull --workflowsid <workflowId>

# 3. Edit the local .workflow.ts file

# 4. Push it back
n8nac push --workflowsid <workflowId>
```

---

## 🏗 Part of the Ecosystem
- `@n8n-as-code/skills`: AI-integration tools (node search, schemas, context generation).
- `vscode-extension`: Visual editing in VS Code (uses this package as its sync library).
