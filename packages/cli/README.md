# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EtienneLescot/n8n-as-code/main/res/logo.png" alt="n8n-as-code logo" width="32" height="32"> n8nac

The main command-line interface for the **n8n-as-code** ecosystem. Manage, synchronize, and version-control your n8n workflows as TypeScript files.

> This package also embeds the synchronization engine and exposes it as a library for the VS Code extension. It includes a `skills` subcommand group that forwards to `@n8n-as-code/skills` for AI agent tooling.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g n8nac
```

## Commands

### `init`
Interactive wizard — configure the connection to an n8n instance and pick the active project.

```bash
n8nac init
```

Creates `n8nac.json` in the current folder and stores the API key outside the repo.

---

### `switch`
Switch the active n8n project (updates `projectId` / `projectName` in `n8nac.json`).

```bash
n8nac switch
```

---

### `list`
Display workflow status in a git-like model. By default shows combined local and remote workflows.

```bash
n8nac list                    # Combined view (default)
n8nac list --local            # Show only local workflows
n8nac list --remote           # Show only remote workflows (alias: --distant)
```

Output columns: `Status` · `ID` · `Name` · `Local Path`

Status values:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `TRACKED`             | Workflow exists on both sides, in sync                              | Nothing to do |
| `CONFLICT`            | Both sides changed — detected at push/pull time | `n8nac resolve <id> --mode keep-current` (keep local) or `keep-incoming` (keep remote) |
| `EXIST_ONLY_LOCALLY`  | New local file not yet in n8n (or remote was deleted) | `n8nac push <id>` or `n8nac push --filename <file>` if brand-new |
| `EXIST_ONLY_REMOTELY` | Remote workflow not yet local (or local was deleted) | `n8nac pull <workflowId>` to download |

> **Git-like sync**: Status is a point-in-time observation. Use `fetch` to update remote state cache.
> **For agents**: always run `n8nac list` first to get workflow IDs and their current status before pulling or pushing.

---

### `fetch <workflowId>`
Update remote state cache for a specific workflow (internal reference for comparison).

```bash
n8nac fetch <workflowId>          # Fetch specific workflow's remote state
```

- Updates internal comparison cache for the specified workflow only
- Use before `list` to ensure status reflects latest remote state for that workflow
- Required for accurate conflict detection
- For heavy instances, fetch individual workflows rather than all at once

---

### `pull <workflowId>`
Download a single workflow from n8n and overwrite the local file.

```bash
n8nac pull <workflowId>
```

> Recommended for agents and scripts. Targets exactly one workflow.

---

### `push`
Upload a single local workflow file to n8n.

```bash
# Existing workflow (has an ID in n8nac list)
n8nac push <workflowId>

# Brand-new local file never pushed before (no remote ID yet)
n8nac push --filename my-workflow.workflow.ts
```

> **Which form to use?** If `n8nac list` shows a workflow with an ID, always use `push <id>`.
> Only use `--filename` for files that have never been pushed and have no entry in `.n8n-state.json`.

---

### `resolve <id> --mode <mode>`
Explicitly resolve a conflict for a specific workflow.

```bash
n8nac resolve <id> --mode keep-current    # Force-push local version
n8nac resolve <id> --mode keep-incoming   # Force-pull remote version
```

---

### `update-ai`
Generate or refresh AI context files in the project root. This command creates `AGENTS.md` and VS Code snippets.

```bash
n8nac update-ai
# or equivalently:
n8nac skills update-ai
```

AI tooling commands are available as `n8nac skills <command>` — powered by `@n8n-as-code/skills`. Run via npx (no global install needed):

```bash
npx n8nac skills --help
npx n8nac skills search "google sheets"
npx n8nac skills node-info googleSheets
```

---

### `convert`
Convert a single workflow between JSON and TypeScript formats.

```bash
n8nac convert <file>
n8nac convert my-workflow.json --format typescript
n8nac convert my-workflow.workflow.ts --format json
```

### `convert-batch`
Batch-convert all workflows in a directory.

```bash
n8nac convert-batch workflows/ --format typescript
```

---

## 🤖 Agent workflow

The intended flow for an AI agent editing a workflow:

```bash
# 1. Fetch current state and get workflow IDs
n8nac list

# 2. Pull the target workflow
n8nac pull <workflowId>

# 3. Edit the local .workflow.ts file

# 4. Push it back
n8nac push <workflowId>
```

---

## 🏗 Part of the Ecosystem
- `@n8n-as-code/skills`: Internal AI-integration library (node search, schemas, context generation) — accessible via `n8nac skills`.
- `vscode-extension`: Visual editing in VS Code (uses this package as its sync library).
