## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- fix(sync): prevent infinite sync loops by cleaning metadata before write

  - Use WorkflowSanitizer.cleanForStorage() to remove dynamic metadata before writing to local files
  - Remove forced refresh in watcher.resumeObservation() to avoid sync loops in auto-sync mode
  - Ensures local and remote states remain consistent without triggering unnecessary sync cycles

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- fix(watcher): handle workflows without ID and filename inconsistencies

  - Add pause/resume observation by filename for new workflows
  - Implement ID-based workflow identification to prevent filename mismatches
  - Add comprehensive test suite for workflow identification edge cases

  The changes address critical issues where:

  1. Workflows without IDs (new workflows) couldn't be properly paused during sync
  2. Filename vs workflow.name vs workflow.id inconsistencies caused sync failures
  3. Renamed workflows in n8n UI or locally renamed files weren't properly tracked

  BREAKING CHANGE: The watcher now prioritizes workflow ID over filename for identification, which may affect workflows that relied on filename-based matching.
