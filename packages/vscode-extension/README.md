> **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE (v0.11.0)**: Workflows are now stored as **TypeScript files** (`.workflow.ts`) instead of JSON. This provides better IntelliSense, type safety, and AI-assisted editing.

**n8n-as-code** transforms VS Code into a powerful IDE for your n8n workflows. Your automations become code: Git versioning, AI-assisted editing, and seamless synchronization.

## 🎨 Features

### 🔄 Git-like Synchronization
The extension follows a git-like model: **List**, **Fetch**, **Pull**, and **Push**. You have full control over when changes are synchronized.

### 🛡️ Conflict Management
The system intelligently detects conflicts to prevent data loss:
- **Protection**: If a workflow is modified simultaneously on n8n and locally, synchronization stops.
- **Resolution**: An interface allows you to compare versions (Diff View) and choose which one to keep (Force Push/Pull).

### 🗂️ Multi-Instance Support
Your workflows are automatically organized by instance to avoid mixing files from different environments:
`workflows/instance_name_user/my_workflow.json`

### 🤖 Built-in AI Assistance
Your environment is automatically configured for AI upon opening:
-   **JSON Validation**: n8n schema applied for input assistance and live error detection.
-   **Snippet Library**: Ready-to-use node templates (`node:webhook`, `node:code`, etc.).
-   **`AGENTS.md` Context**: Automated documentation generated using `@n8n-as-code/skills` so that Cline, Cursor, Windsurf, or Copilot can master your workflow structure.

### 🛠️ Integrated Tooling
The extension leverages the `@n8n-as-code/skills` package to:
- **Index Nodes**: Pre-generate a searchable index of available n8n nodes.
- **AI Initialization**: Power the `n8n.initializeAI` command to bootstrap your environment with relevant context.

### 🍱 Split View
Visualize the n8n canvas in real-time using the integrated Webview while editing the JSON code. This is the ideal interface for visually validating your structural changes.
