# Usage Guides

Welcome to the n8n-as-code usage guides. This section provides detailed instructions for using the primary tools in the n8n-as-code ecosystem.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

This section is organized by the primary user-facing tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **[VS Code Extension](/docs/usage/vscode-extension)** | Integrated development environment | Visual editing, git-like sync, workflow validation |
| **[CLI](/docs/usage/cli)** | Command-line interface | Automation, scripting, CI/CD integration |
| **[Skills CLI](/docs/usage/skills)** | AI tools and node schemas | AI coding assistants, node search, schema retrieval |
| **[Claude Plugin](/docs/usage/claude-skill)** | Claude Code plugin | High-level workflow creation, updates, and fixes through Claude |
| **[OpenClaw Plugin](/docs/usage/openclaw)** | OpenClaw plugin | Workspace bootstrap, prompt grounding, and workflow operations inside OpenClaw |

## 🎨 Choosing the Right Tool

### For Visual Workflow Editing (Recommended)
Use the **VS Code Extension** if you:
- Prefer a visual interface with split-view editing
- Want git-like synchronization (push/pull/fetch) with explicit control
- Need workflow validation and schema checking
- Work primarily in VS Code for development
- Want to see n8n canvas preview while editing JSON

### For Automation and Scripting
Use the **CLI** if you:
- Need to automate workflow management tasks
- Want to integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- Prefer working in the terminal
- Need to script bulk operations
- Want to run n8n-as-code in headless environments

## 🔄 Common Workflows

### Basic Workflow Management with VS Code

    C --> D[Edit in Split View]
    D --> E[Push to n8n via Context Menu]
    E --> F[Version Control with Git]
```

### Automation Pipeline with CLI

```mermaid

    A[Git Push] --> B[CI/CD Pipeline]
    B --> C[Run Tests]
    C --> D[Validate JSON]
    D --> E[Push to n8n]
    E --> F[Deploy to Production]
```

## 🛠️ Integration Examples

### VS Code + Git Integration

1. **Edit workflows** in VS Code with git-like sync controls
2. **Push changes** to n8n via the context menu
3. **Commit changes** to Git for version control
3. **Review changes** using Git diff
4. **Collaborate** with team members via Git
5. **Deploy** using CI/CD pipelines

### CLI + Automation Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example automation script for CI/CD

# List available workflows on source instance
n8nac list

# Pull the specific workflows you need
n8nac pull <workflowId>

# Validate JSON syntax (using jq or other tools)
find workflows/ -name "*.json" -exec jq . {} >/dev/null 2>&1 \;

# Push to target environment
export N8N_HOST="https://target.n8n.example.com"
export N8N_API_KEY="$TARGET_API_KEY"
n8nac init
n8nac push workflows/instance/project/workflow.workflow.ts
```

## 🚀 Getting Started with Each Tool

### 1. VS Code Extension (Recommended)
1. Install from VS Code Marketplace
2. Configure connection in extension settings
3. Open workflow tree view from Activity Bar
4. Use context menu actions (right-click) for fetch, pull, push operations

### 2. CLI
1. Install globally: `npm install -g n8nac`
2. Initialize: `n8nac init`
3. (Optional) Switch project: `n8nac switch`
4. Sync workflows: `n8nac pull`
4. Use commands as needed for automation

### 3. AI Tools (via `n8nac skills`)
1. Run with npx: `npx n8nac skills --help`
2. Search for nodes: `npx n8nac skills search "query"`
3. Get node schemas: `npx n8nac skills node-info nodeName`
4. Use output for AI context or development

### 4. Claude Plugin (For Claude Code)
1. Add the marketplace: `/plugin marketplace add EtienneLescot/n8n-as-code`
2. Install the plugin: `/plugin install n8n-as-code@n8nac-marketplace`
3. Ask Claude high-level workflow requests
4. See [Claude Plugin Guide](/docs/usage/claude-skill) for details

### 5. OpenClaw Plugin
1. Install the plugin: `openclaw plugins install @n8n-as-code/openclaw-plugin`
2. Run the setup wizard: `openclaw n8nac:setup`
3. Restart the gateway: `openclaw gateway restart`
4. See the [OpenClaw Plugin Guide](/docs/usage/openclaw) for details

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Multi-Instance Management
Work with multiple n8n instances. Workflows are automatically organized by instance to avoid mixing files from different environments.

### Git-like Sync Workflow
Follow a git-like pattern for synchronization: list workflows to see status, pull changes you want, edit locally, then push changes back.

Use `n8nac list` to check status, `n8nac pull` to download by workflow ID, and `n8nac push <path>` to upload the local workflow file you want to send.

### Git Integration
Store workflows as JSON files in Git for version control, collaboration, and deployment pipelines.

### AI Assistant Support
Generate context files that help AI coding assistants understand n8n workflow structure and provide accurate suggestions.
