# Claude Plugin

The `n8n-as-code` Claude Code plugin adds the `n8n-architect` skill and turns Claude into an n8n workflow expert.

The important point is that this stays **high-level for the user**. The user does not need to think in terms of TypeScript decorators, `n8nac skills search`, or exact node schemas. Those are implementation details used by the agent behind the scenes.

Typical requests look like this:

- `Create a workflow that watches new Typeform responses and sends them to Slack`
- `Add a Google Sheets node to the onboarding workflow`
- `Fix the error in the invoice workflow`
- `Update the AI agent workflow to use a memory node`

Claude then guides the user through initialization if needed, and uses `n8nac` commands such as `init`, `list`, `pull`, `push`, and `skills ...` internally to do the work safely.

## 🎯 What This Plugin Adds

Claude Code plugins can bundle skills, manifests, and marketplace metadata. In this case, the plugin provides:

1. **A Claude Code plugin manifest** in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
2. **A plugin marketplace manifest** in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
3. **The `n8n-architect` skill** in `skills/n8n-architect/SKILL.md`

This lets users install the plugin directly from GitHub through Claude Code, while keeping the CLI alias `n8nac` for the underlying commands.

## ✨ What the User Experiences

When installed, Claude can:

- ✅ Understand high-level workflow requests in natural language
- ✅ Guide the user through `n8nac init` if the workspace is not initialized yet
- ✅ Pull the current workflow state before editing
- ✅ Search exact nodes and schemas behind the scenes to avoid hallucinations
- ✅ Push verified changes back to n8n after local edits
- ✅ Fix existing workflow issues without making the user reason about internal TypeScript structure

## 🏗️ How It Works

```
User: "Add a Slack notification step to the lead intake workflow"
         ↓
Claude detects n8n context and loads the n8n-architect skill
         ↓
Claude checks whether the project is initialized and guides the user if needed
         ↓
Claude runs: n8nac list / pull / skills search / node-info as needed
         ↓
Claude edits the local `.workflow.ts` file with the correct schema-backed config
         ↓
Claude validates and pushes the workflow back to n8n
```

The user stays at the level of intent. The TypeScript workflow representation is an implementation detail that helps the agent make safe, reviewable edits.

## 📦 Plugin Source of Truth

The canonical public plugin repository is:

```text
https://github.com/EtienneLescot/n8n-as-code
```

For marketplace and directory submissions, this is the correct **Link to plugin** field because the plugin manifests and skill files live in the root repo.

The public documentation page for the plugin is:

```text
https://etiennelescot.github.io/n8n-as-code/docs/usage/claude-skill/
```

This is the correct **Plugin homepage** field for submissions.

## 📦 Building the Plugin Assets

From the monorepo root:

```bash
npm run build:claude-plugin
```

This builds the skills package and regenerates the committed Claude skill at `skills/n8n-architect/`, plus the distributable adapter under `packages/skills/dist/adapters/claude/n8n-architect/`.

## 🚀 Installation

### For Claude Code (Marketplace Install)

```text
/plugin marketplace add EtienneLescot/n8n-as-code
/plugin install n8n-as-code@n8nac-marketplace
```

This is the recommended install path for Claude Code.

### For Claude.ai (Web)

1. **Build and package:**
   ```bash
  npm run build:claude-plugin
   cd dist/adapters/claude
   zip -r n8n-architect-skill.zip n8n-architect/
   ```

2. **Upload to Claude:**
   - Go to [claude.ai/settings/features](https://claude.ai/settings/features)
   - Find "Custom Skills"
   - Click "Upload Skill"
   - Select `n8n-architect-skill.zip`

3. **Verify:**
   Start a new chat and ask: "Can you help me with n8n?"
   
   Claude should acknowledge the n8n context automatically.

### For Claude Code (Manual Install)

1. **Build and install:**
   ```bash
  npm run build:claude-plugin
   
   # Install globally
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
  cp -r packages/skills/dist/adapters/claude/n8n-architect ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code**

3. **Verify:**
   The skill loads automatically. Ask about n8n to test.

### For Claude API

When using the Claude API with the [`skills` beta](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/use-skills-with-the-claude-api):

```typescript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const client = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
});

const response = await client.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219',
  max_tokens: 4096,
  betas: [
    'code-execution-2025-08-25',
    'skills-2025-10-02',
    'files-api-2025-04-14'
  ],
  container: {
    type: 'code_execution_2025_01',
    skills: ['n8n-architect']
  },
  messages: [{
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Create a workflow with an HTTP Request node'
  }]
});

console.log(response.content);
```

## ✅ Example User Requests

These are better examples than low-level schema questions, because they match how users actually talk to Claude.

### Create a workflow
```
"Create a workflow that reads new Stripe payments and posts a summary to Slack"
```
Expected: Claude guides initialization if needed, finds the right nodes, and creates the workflow.

### Update an existing workflow
```
"Add a Google Sheets node to the customer onboarding workflow"
```
Expected: Claude pulls the workflow if needed, edits the correct file, and updates routing safely.

### Fix a broken workflow
```
"Fix the error in the invoice reminder workflow"
```
Expected: Claude inspects the existing workflow, diagnoses invalid node config or AI wiring, and proposes or applies a fix.

### Refactor an AI workflow
```
"Update the support agent workflow to use memory and an OpenAI chat model"
```
Expected: Claude uses `.uses()` correctly for AI sub-nodes and keeps the workflow valid.

## 🔧 How the Plugin Works Internally

The skill reuses content from `@n8n-as-code/skills`'s `AiContextGenerator`:

```typescript
// Same content as getAgentsContent() from skills
const skillContent = `
## 🎭 Role: Expert n8n Engineer
You manage n8n workflows as **clean, version-controlled JSON**.

### 🔬 Research Protocol (MANDATORY)
Do NOT hallucinate node parameters. Use these tools:
- npx n8nac skills search "<term>"
- npx n8nac skills node-info "<nodeName>"
...
`;
```

This ensures consistency between AGENTS.md for other coding agents and SKILL.md for Claude.

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ Runs 100% locally (no external servers)
- ✅ Uses NPX to execute `n8nac skills`
- ✅ Open-source and auditable
- ⚠️ Requires Node.js and npm on the machine
- ⚠️ First run downloads `n8nac` via NPX

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Skill not loading

**Claude.ai:**
- Ensure you're on Pro/Team/Enterprise plan
- Check Settings → Features for the skill
- Try re-uploading the ZIP

**Claude Code:**
- Verify folder exists: `ls ~/.claude/skills/n8n-architect/`
- Check SKILL.md has YAML frontmatter
- Restart Claude Code

### NPX commands fail

- Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
- Verify: `npx --version`
- For Claude.ai: Check if code execution has network access in settings

### Claude doesn't use the plugin as expected

- Be explicit: "Using n8n-architect skill, help me..."
- Check the description field matches your use case
- Ensure YAML frontmatter is valid (run `npm run validate`)
