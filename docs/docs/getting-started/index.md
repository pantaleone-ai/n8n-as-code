# Getting Started with n8nac

Welcome to n8nac! This guide will help you set up and start using n8nac to manage your n8n workflows as code.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll learn how to:

1. Install n8nac VS Code Extension or CLI
2. Configure your connection to n8n
3. Sync your existing workflows
4. Start editing workflows in VS Code

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **n8n instance** running (self-hosted or cloud)
- **API key** from your n8n instance (found in Settings > API)
- **VS Code** (recommended for the best experience)

## 🚀 Quick Start: VS Code Extension (Recommended)

The VS Code Extension provides the best user experience with visual editing, git-like sync controls, and workflow validation.

### Step 1: Install VS Code Extension

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "n8nac"
4. Click Install

### Step 2: Configure Connection

1. Click the n8n icon in the Activity Bar
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) to open settings
3. Enter your n8n host URL (e.g., `https://n8n.yourdomain.com`)
4. Enter your n8n API key
5. The extension automatically loads your projects and pre-selects your Personal project
6. Verify your settings and click "Save settings"

### Step 3: Sync Your Workflows

1. Click the refresh button in the n8n panel
2. Your workflows will be downloaded and organized by instance
3. Use the context menu (right-click on a workflow) to **fetch**, **pull**, and **push** changes

## 🛠️ Alternative: CLI Installation

If you prefer command-line tools or need automation:

### Install CLI via npm

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g n8nac

# Verify installation
n8nac --version
```

### Initialize Your Project

```bash
# Run initialization wizard
n8nac init
```

The interactive wizard will guide you through:
- **n8n Host URL**: The URL of your n8n instance
- **API Key**: Your n8n API key
- **Sync Folder**: Local folder where workflow files are written
- **Project**: Which n8n project to sync

### Sync Workflows (Git-like Pattern)

```bash
# List workflows to see current status
n8nac list

# Fetch remote state for a specific workflow
n8nac fetch --workflowsid <workflowId>

# Pull that workflow locally
n8nac pull --workflowsid <workflowId>

# After editing, push changes back
n8nac push --workflowsid <workflowId>
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

After setup, you'll have:

- `n8nac-config.json`: Project configuration (safe to commit to Git)
- Global API key storage (not committed, stored securely in your system)

## 🔄 Syncing Your Workflows

### Pull a Workflow

Download a specific workflow from your n8n instance:

```bash
# List workflows to see what's available
n8nac list

# Pull the workflow you want
n8nac pull --workflowsid <workflowId>
```

This will:
- Download the workflow file to your local directory
- Refuse to overwrite if a conflict is detected (use `n8nac resolve` in that case)

### Push Local Changes

Send your local modifications back to n8n:

- **VS Code Extension**: Use the context menu on workflow items (right-click → Push)
- **CLI**: Use `n8nac push --workflowsid <workflowId>` command

### Git-like Sync Workflow

Follow this git-like pattern for synchronization:

```bash
# 1. Check status
n8nac list

# 2. Fetch remote state for specific workflows
n8nac fetch --workflowsid <workflowId>

# 3. Pull remote changes
n8nac pull --workflowsid <workflowId>

# 4. Edit workflow locally
# ... make changes ...

# 5. Push local changes
n8nac push --workflowsid <workflowId>

# 6. If a conflict is reported, resolve it
n8nac resolve --workflowsid <workflowId> --mode keep-current   # keep local
n8nac resolve --workflowsid <workflowId> --mode keep-incoming  # keep remote
```

This explicit command pattern gives you full control over when to sync, similar to git workflow. For heavy instances, fetch individual workflows rather than all at once.

## 🎨 VS Code Extension Features

Once configured, you'll have access to:

- **Workflow Tree View**: Browse all your workflows in the sidebar with status indicators
- **Split View Editing**: Edit JSON while viewing the n8n canvas
- **Git-like Sync**: Context menu actions for fetch, pull, and push operations
- **Validation & Snippets**: JSON validation and code snippets
- **AI Context Generation**: Files to help AI assistants understand n8n workflows

## 📁 Project Structure

After setup, your project will look like this:

```
your-project/
├── n8nac-config.json          # Project configuration
├── workflows/                # Workflow storage
│   └── instance-name_user/       # Instance identifier (auto-generated)
│       └── project-slug/         # Project slug (from project name)
│           ├── workflow-1.json
│           ├── workflow-2.json
│           └── folder/
│               └── workflow-3.json
├── AGENTS.md                # AI assistant instructions (optional)
├── n8nac-config.json # Instance configuration
└── .git/                    # Version control (recommended)
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Can't connect to n8n instance
**Solution**: 
- Verify the n8n URL is correct and accessible
- Check that API key has proper permissions
- Ensure n8n instance is running and accessible

### Permission Issues

**Problem**: "Permission denied" when writing files
**Solution**:
- Check directory permissions
- Run with appropriate user privileges
- Use a different project directory

### Sync Issues

**Problem**: Changes not syncing properly
**Solution**:
- Use `n8nac list` to check workflow status
- Use `n8nac fetch --workflowsid <workflowId>` to update remote state cache for specific workflows
- Use `n8nac pull --workflowsid <workflowId>` to get fresh copy
- Use `n8nac push --workflowsid <workflowId>` to send local changes
- Use `n8nac resolve --workflowsid <workflowId> --mode keep-current|keep-incoming` if a conflict is reported
- Check network connectivity to n8n instance
