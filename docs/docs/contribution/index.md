## 🛠 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Git

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory
3. Build all packages with `npm run build`
4. Run tests with `npm test`

## 📦 Package Structure

n8n-as-code is organized as a monorepo with the following packages:

| Package | Purpose | Primary Users |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **CLI** (`n8nac`) | Command-line interface + embedded sync engine | Terminal users, automation |
| **VS Code Extension** | Integrated development environment | VS Code users |
| **Skills Library** (`@n8n-as-code/skills`, accessed via `n8nac skills`) | AI context generation and node schemas | AI assistants, developers |

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with Jest
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow tests
- **Snapshot Tests**: Ensure generated files match expected format

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests for specific package
cd packages/skills && npm test
cd packages/cli && npm test
```

## 🔧 Building

### Development Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Watch Mode (Development)
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📦 Version Management

n8n-as-code uses **Changeset** with independent package versioning. Each package evolves independently while Changeset automatically manages internal dependencies.

### Current Package Versions

Packages evolve **independently** with their own version numbers:
- **n8nac**: `0.9.3` (embeds sync engine, exposes `n8nac skills` subgroup)
- **@n8n-as-code/skills**: `0.2.0` (internal library, used by `n8nac`)
- **VS Code Extension**: `0.2.0`

> **Note**: Each package has its own version number. Changeset ensures that when a package depends on another internal package, it always references the **current version** of that dependency.

### Package Publication Strategy

The project includes different types of packages:

| Package | Published To | Managed By Changeset |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| `n8nac` | NPM Registry | ✅ Yes |
| `@n8n-as-code/skills` | NPM Registry | ✅ Yes |
| `n8n-as-code` (VS Code Extension) | VS Code Marketplace | ✅ Yes (versioning only) |
| `n8n-as-code-monorepo` (root) | Not published | ❌ No (ignored) |
| `docs` | Not published | ❌ No (private) |

**Important**: The VS Code extension is marked as `"private": true` to prevent accidental NPM publication, but **it is still managed by Changeset** for version numbering and dependency synchronization. Changeset automatically skips private packages during `changeset publish`.

### Release Workflow

#### Step 1: Create Changeset (Developer)

After modifying code, document your changes:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

This command:
- Creates a file `.changeset/random-name-123.md`
- Prompts you to select affected packages (including VS Code extension if modified)
- Asks for version bump type: `patch` (0.3.0→0.3.1), `minor` (0.3.0→0.4.0), `major` (0.3.0→1.0.0)
- Requests a changelog message

**Important**: Commit this changeset file with your code changes.

#### Step 2: Version Packages PR (Automated)

When changesets are pushed to `main`, the CI creates a **"Version Packages"** Pull Request automatically:

- Reads all `.changeset/*.md` files
- Updates `package.json` versions for ALL packages (including private ones)
- Automatically updates internal dependencies across all packages
- Generates/updates `CHANGELOG.md` files
- Deletes processed changeset files
- Creates a single PR with all these changes

#### Step 3: Merge & Publish (Automated)

When the "Version Packages" PR is merged:

1. **NPM Publication**:
   - Builds all packages
   - Publishes public packages to NPM registry (`n8nac`, `@n8n-as-code/skills`)
   - Skips private packages automatically (monorepo root, VS Code extension, docs)
   - Creates Git tags for each published package (e.g., `n8nac@0.9.3`)

2. **VS Code Extension**:
   - Separately publishes to VS Code Marketplace using the version from package.json
   - No Git tag created for the extension (private package)

3. **GitHub Releases**:
   - **ENABLED** - One GitHub Release is created per published package
   - Each package has its own release timeline (e.g., `n8nac@0.9.4`, `@n8n-as-code/skills@0.3.0`)
   - Release notes are automatically extracted from each package's CHANGELOG.md
   - Private packages (VS Code extension) do not get GitHub Releases automatically

### Example: How Internal Dependencies Stay Synchronized

Let's say you fix a bug in the sync engine (embedded in `n8nac`):

```bash
# 1. Create a changeset for the fix
npm run changeset
# Select: n8nac
# Type: patch (0.9.3 → 0.9.4)

# 2. Apply versions
npm run version-packages
```

**Result:**
- `n8nac`: `0.9.3` → `0.9.4` ✅
- `@n8n-as-code/skills`: (unchanged, no dependency on n8nac) ✅
- `VS Code Extension`: `0.14.1` → `0.14.2` (auto-bumped because it depends on n8nac) ✅

All packages that depend on `n8nac` will have their `package.json` updated to reference `"n8nac": "0.9.4"`.

### Workflow Summary Diagram

```
Developer makes changes
       ↓
npm run changeset (creates .changeset/xyz.md)
       ↓
git commit + git push
       ↓
CI detects changeset files → Creates "Version Packages" PR
       ↓
Maintainer reviews & merges PR
       ↓
CI automatically:
  ├─→ Publishes to NPM (n8nac, @n8n-as-code/skills)
  ├─→ Creates Git tags (one per package)
  └─→ Publishes VS Code extension to Marketplace
```

### Key Rules
- **Never manually edit versions** in package.json
- **Always use Changeset** even for small fixes
- **Include VS Code extension in changesets** when you modify it - this ensures dependencies stay synchronized
- **Internal dependencies are automatically updated** thanks to `"updateInternalDependencies": "patch"` in Changeset config
- **Private packages are safe** - Changeset will manage their versions but never publish them to NPM
- **Use `npm run check-versions`** to verify all internal dependencies are up-to-date
- **Git tags are created automatically** for each published NPM package
- **GitHub Releases are created automatically** - One release per package with its own timeline
- **Each package has independent releases** - No global monorepo release

### GitHub Releases per Package

When a "Version Packages" PR is merged, Changeset automatically creates:

**For each published NPM package:**
- ✅ GitHub Release (e.g., `n8nac@0.9.4`)
- ✅ Git Tag with the same name
- ✅ Release notes extracted from the package's CHANGELOG.md

**For private packages (VS Code extension):**
- ❌ No GitHub Release (private packages are skipped)
- ℹ️  You can create manual releases if needed

**Example timeline on GitHub:**
```
Releases
├─ n8nac@0.9.4                     (Jan 20, 2024)
├─ @n8n-as-code/skills@0.3.0       (Jan 18, 2024)
└─ n8nac@0.9.3                     (Jan 15, 2024)
```

Each package maintains its own release history!
